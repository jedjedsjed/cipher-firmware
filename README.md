### *Cipher Firmware*

Cipher Firmware is a next-generation penetration testing firmware designed to move beyond the limitations of existing solutions. Our goal is to provide a powerful, flexible, and community-driven platform by combining well-established tools with innovative new capabilities.

We are starting with a solid foundation—integrating renowned tools used throughout the security community—while actively developing original features that will set Cipher apart. As the project evolves, more advanced and experimental tools will be introduced.

🚀 ###First Beta Release

The initial beta release is built for the LilyGo T-Dongle S3.
